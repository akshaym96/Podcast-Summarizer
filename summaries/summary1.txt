In this podcast episode, Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and professor, discusses his work on climate science and the impact of his famous "hockey stick curve" graph, which shows the dramatic increase in global temperatures over the past century. He explains that the graph became a symbol in the climate change debate and attracted criticism and attacks from fossil fuel interests and climate deniers. Mann also discusses the tactics used by these interests, including deflection, division, and delay, to prevent action on climate change. He emphasizes the importance of collective action and policy changes to address the climate crisis, rather than focusing solely on individual actions. Mann encourages individuals to use their voice and vote for politicians who will prioritize climate action.
