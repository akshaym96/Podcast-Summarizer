The text is a transcript from a podcast episode discussing the responses to the failure of capitalism after the great financial crisis. The first response mentioned is the Tea Party movement, which blamed the government for bailing out banks and felt that regular Americans were being neglected. The movement used the language of capitalism and free markets to criticize the government and promote their cause. The billionaire Koch brothers secretly funded the movement, which eventually became a powerful part of the Republican Party and played a role in the election of Donald Trump. The second response discussed is the Occupy Wall Street movement, which emerged in 2011 and protested against corporate greed and economic inequality. Occupy Wall Street had a strong critique of capitalism and mobilized large numbers of people in demonstrations and actions. It helped popularize anti-capitalist sentiment and contributed to the rise of democratic socialist ideas and movements like Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Socialists of America. The podcast concludes by noting that both responses to the failure of capitalism led to the election of President Trump, highlighting the discontent with the system and the need for change.
