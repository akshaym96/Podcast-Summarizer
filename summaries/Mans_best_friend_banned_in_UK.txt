The text is a transcript from a podcast episode discussing the responses to the failures of American capitalism during the great financial crisis. The first response was the Tea Party movement, which emerged after the crisis and expressed rage at the government bailing out banks and homeowners who couldn't afford their mortgages. The movement used the language of capitalism and free markets to critique the actions of the government and the banks. The podcast mentions individuals such as Rick Santelli, a CNBC personality who called for a Chicago Tea Party, and Bill Hennessey, a Tea Party activist who organized a St. Louis Tea Party. The Tea Party movement was supported by the billionaire Koch brothers and contributed to the rise of Donald Trump. The second response to the crisis was the Occupy Wall Street movement, which emerged in 2011 and criticized capitalism itself. The movement focused on wealth inequality and the disproportionate influence of corporations and Wall Street in politics. The podcast features interviews with individuals involved in Occupy Wall Street, such as Sonny Singh and Sandy Nurse. Occupy Wall Street had a significant impact on popularizing anti-capitalist and socialist ideas, and it played a role in the growing popularity of figures like Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Socialists of America. The episode concludes by suggesting that both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street led to a sense of grievance and a feeling that both democracy and capitalism had failed, ultimately contributing to the election of Donald Trump.
