In June, Hardeep Singh Nizjar, the president of a Sikh temple in Vancouver, was shot and killed in the temple parking lot. The incident sparked accusations and speculations about who was responsible for his death. In the Sikh community, Nizjar was a respected leader, known for advocating for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan. However, the Indian government considered him a terrorist and had issued an arrest warrant for him. The Canadian government recently made a bombshell declaration, accusing the Indian government of involvement in Nizjar's murder. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, publicly stated that Canadian security agencies had credible allegations linking Indian agents to the killing. India vehemently denied the accusations, calling them absurd and motivated. The accusation has strained the relationship between Canada and India, with India expelling a Canadian diplomat and issuing a travel advisory to Indians wanting to visit Canada. The Canadian Sikh community has welcomed Trudeau's accusation, while Canadians are grappling with the implications of the allegations and the safety of their borders. The Canadian government claims to have evidence linking India to the murder, but the details of the evidence have not been made public. The timing of the accusation is significant, as India is trying to establish itself as a global player and improve its image on the world stage. The allegations could harm India's reputation and reopen discussions about its record on human rights and treatment of religious minorities. The motives behind India's alleged involvement are unclear, but possible factors include the emotive nature of the Sikh separatist issue and a history of extrajudicial killings in India. As for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he is likely to come out relatively unscathed domestically, given the acceptance of extrajudicial killings in India and the nationalist sentiments that he taps into. Modi may believe that any negative international press will be short-lived, as India is seen as increasingly important in countering China and as an economic and security partner.
