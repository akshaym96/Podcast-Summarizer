The text is a transcript from a podcast episode titled "Blame Capitalism." It discusses two responses to the financial crisis and the failure of capitalism. The first response was the rise of the Tea Party, a conservative movement that blamed the government for bailing out big banks and felt that the losers of the financial crisis were being rewarded. The Tea Party capitalized on the anger and divided Americans further through its anti-government and anti-Big Bank sentiment. The second response was the Occupy Wall Street movement, which was a progressive and anti-capitalist movement. Occupy Wall Street critiqued the capitalist system and highlighted income inequality. The movement brought the critique of capitalism into the mainstream and contributed to the popularity of democratic socialist ideas and politicians like Bernie Sanders. Despite their different ideologies, both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street tapped into a sense of grievance and a feeling that democracy and capitalism had failed. They ultimately led to the election of President Donald Trump, who tapped into the anger and resentment against the establishment. The episode ends by suggesting that the failures of capitalism have opened the door for previously unthinkable changes to the system.
